# Igia

üë∑üèø‚Äç under development ...

Igia is a Python project that simulates stock trading strategies using agent-based modeling and PyTorch. 

The project uses the Mesa library for agent-based modeling, and implements a Q-learning algorithm using PyTorch to generate trading strategies. The project is intended for anyone who is interested in trading and simulation, and includes a variety of stock trading strategies that users can explore.

Please note that Igia is for educational purposes only, and should not be used for actual stock trading.

## Installation

To install Igia, simply clone the repository and run `poetry install` in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/proteusiq/igia.git
cd igia
poetry install
```
## Usage

To run the project, simply run the `igia` command. This will launch a UI where you can interact with the simulation. The UI displays the number of agents (traders) and their worth, and allows you to explore different stock trading strategies using the Q-learning algorithm implemented in PyTorch.

## Stock Trading Strategies

Igia includes a variety of stock trading strategies that users can explore, including:

Buy and Hold: This strategy involves buying a stock and holding it for a long period of time, regardless of short-term fluctuations in price.

Mean Reversion: This strategy involves buying a stock when its price falls below its historical average, and selling it when its price rises above its historical average.

Momentum: This strategy involves buying a stock when its price is rising, and selling it when its price starts to fall.
Users can also create their own custom trading strategies using the Q-learning algorithm implemented in PyTorch.

## Additional Information

Igia is intended for educational purposes only, and should not be used for actual stock trading.

There are currently no known issues or bugs with the project.

Igia requires Python 3.8 or higher to run.

## Final Remarks

Thank you for your interest in Igia! I hope you find this project informative and enjoyable.
